The plan is to gradually promote adjustments:
1. Adjust the size of the buckle so that it can fit the gopro socket in the market. (Has been completed)
2. Add LeTV phone case. (During testing)
3. Adjust the structural defects of the mobile phone case. (under design)
4. Cancel the hardware. Use the wood structure to ensure the strength of the buckle. (To be started)
